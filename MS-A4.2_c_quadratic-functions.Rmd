# Learning Intentions

#### Topic
**Non-linear Relationships**

#### Learning Goals
Quadratic Functions

#### Success Criteria

* Construct and analyse a quadratic model to solve practical problems involving quadratic functions or expressions of the form $y=ax^2+bx+c$, for example braking distance against speed
  * recognise the shape of a parabola and that it always has a turning point and an axis of symmetry
  * graph a quadratic function with and without technology

#### Activities/Tasks
Refer to Edmodo

# Starter question

There are currently 1000 possums in a national park. The population is expected to fall by 7% each year.

a) Write an exponential function for the expected possum population $P$ after $n$ years.

b) Find the expected population after 1 year, 5 years and 10 years.

c) Sketch the graph of $P$ against $n$

d) Use your graph to estimate the population after 3 years.

# Quadratic Functions

--

Quadratic functions are functions where the highest power on an $x$ term is 2. 

--

i.e. $$y=ax^2+bx+c$$ Where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants

--

For example, $$y=3x^2-4$$

---

# $y=x^2$

# Observations

--

* There is a vertex (or turning point) at $(0,0)$

--

  * This is the minimum value

--

* The graph is symmetrical on each side of the turning point.

---

# $y=ax^2$

# Observations

* There is a vertex (or turning point) at $(0,0)$

  * This is the minimum value

* The graph is symmetrical on each side of the turning point.

---

# Observations

* There is a vertex (or turning point) at $(0,0)$

  * This is the maximum or minimum value

* The graph is symmetrical on each side of the turning point.

# Observations

  * This is the maximum or minimum value

* The graph is symmetrical on each side of the turning point.

--

* $a$ changes how quickly the graph increases and decreases

--

* When $a$ is positive it makes a üôÇ

--

* When $a$ is negative it makes a üôÅ  

--

* $y=ax^2$ and $y=-ax^2$ are reflections in the $x$ axis

* Adding or subtracting a number does _not_ change the shape. It moves it up or down.

--

There can be 0, 1 or 2 $x$-intercepts, and there is 1 $y$-intercept.

# $y=ax^2+bx+c$

# Sketching quadratic graphs

--

1. Construct a table of values

--

2. Draw a number plane

--

3. Plot at least 4 points

--

4. Draw a curve that goes through the points

---

# Example 1

Draw the graph of $y=x^2+1$

---

# $y=x^2+1$

Embed

---

# Example 2

Draw the graph of $y=x^2-4x+3$. Use the graph the find:

a) turning point

b) axis of symmetry

c) $y$-intercept

d) $x$-intercepts

e) minimum or maximum value
