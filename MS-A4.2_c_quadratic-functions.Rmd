# Quadratic Functions

--

Quadratic functions are functions where the highest power on an $x$ term is 2. 

--

i.e. $$y=ax^2+bx+c$$ Where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants

--

For example, $$y=3x^2-4$$

---

# $y=x^2$

---

# $y=ax^2$

Embed here

---

# Observations

--

* There is a vertex (or turning point) at $(0,0)$

--

  * This is the minimum value

--

* The graph is symmetrical on each side of the turning point.

---

# $y=ax^2$

# Observations

  * This is the minimum value

* The graph is symmetrical on each side of the turning point.

# Observations

* There is a vertex (or turning point) at $(0,0)$

  * This is the maximum or minimum value

* The graph is symmetrical on each side of the turning point.

# Observations

* There is a vertex (or turning point) at $(0,0)$

* The graph is symmetrical on each side of the turning point.

  * This is the maximum or minimum value

--

* $a$ changes how quickly the graph increases and decreases

--

* When $a$ is positive it makes a üôÇ

--

* When $a$ is negative it makes a üôÅ  

--

* $y=ax^2$ and $y=-ax^2$ are reflections in the $x$ axis

* Adding or subtracting a number does _not_ change the shape. It moves it up or down.

--

There can be 0, 1 or 2 $x$-intercepts, and there is 1 $y$-intercept.

# Sketching quadratic graphs

--

1. Construct a table of values

--

2. Draw a number plane

--

3. Plot at least 4 points

--

4. Draw a curve that goes through the points

---

# Example 1

Draw the graph of $y=x^2+1$

---

# $y=x^2+1$

Embed

---

# Example 2

Draw the graph of $y=x^2-4x+3$. Use the graph the find:

a) turning point

b) axis of symmetry

c) $y$-intercept

d) $x$-intercepts

e) minimum or maximum value

---

# $y=3^{-x}$
